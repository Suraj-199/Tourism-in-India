The state is divided into 18 divisions and 75 districts, with the capital being Lucknow. On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttarakhand, was carved from the state's Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the Ganges and Yamuna, join at Triveni Sangam in Allahabad and flow further east as Ganges. Other prominent rivers are Gomti and Saryu. The forest cover in the state is 6.09% of the state's geographical area. <br> Uttar Pradesh ranks first in domestic tourist arrivals among all states of India with more than 71 million, owing to its rich and varied topography, vibrant culture, festivals, monuments, ancient places of worship, and viharas. Uttar Pradesh is also home to three World Heritage Sites: the Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri. Uttar Pradesh is a favoured tourist destination in India due to the location of Taj Mahal, nearly 69 lakhs (6.9 million) people visited the Taj Mahal in 2018-19, up an 6% from the previous year when the number stood at 64 lakhs (6.4 million). The monument earned almost ₹78 crore in ticket sales in 2018-19. The state's tourism industry is a major contributor to the state's economy, growing at the rate of 21.60%. <br> Religious tourism plays significant role in Uttar Pradesh tourism as the state has some of the holiest Hindu shrines. Varanasi a major religious hub, is the holiest of the seven sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism and Jainism. Domestic tourist most commonly visit for religious purposes while foreign tourist visit for ghats along river Ganges. Vrindavan is considered to be a holy place for Vaisnavism.

Dwarka is one of the Chardhams, four sacred Hindu pilgrimage sites. Millions gather at Allahabad to take part in the Magh Mela festival on the banks of the Ganges. This festival is organised on a larger scale every 12th year and is called the Kumbh Mela, where over 10 million Hindu pilgrims congregate in one of the largest gatherings of people in the world. Vindhyachal is a Hindu pilgrimage site having the temple of Vindhyavasini. <br> Buddhist attractions in Uttar Pradesh include stupas and monasteries. The historically important towns of Sarnath where Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon after his enlightenment and died at Kushinagar; both are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists. Also at Sarnath are the Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, both important archaeological artefacts with national significance. At a distance of 80 km from Varanasi, Ghazipur is famous not only for its Ghats on the Ganges but also for the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, the 18th-century Governor of East India Company ruled Bengal Presidency. The tomb is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.[267] The state has one National Park and 25 Wildlife Sanctuaries.

		    <br><b>ii) Agra Fort </b><br>Agra Fort is a historical fort in the city of Agra in India. It was the main residence of the emperors of the Mughal Dynasty until 1638, when the capital was shifted from Agra to Delhi. Before capture by the British, the last Indian rulers to have occupied it were the Marathas. In 1983, the Agra fort was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. It is about 2.5 km northwest of its more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more accurately described as a walled city. <br> It had been used by the early mughal rulers. The Fort stands on an ancient site and was traditionally known as Badalgarh. It was captured by Ghaznavi for some time but in the 15th century A.D. the Chauhan Rajputs occupied it. Soon after, Agra assumed the status of capital when Sikandar Lodi (A.D. 1487–1517) shifted his capital from Delhi and constructed a few buildings in the pre-existing Fort at Agra. After the first battle of Panipat (A.D. 1526) Mughals captured the fort and ruled from it. In A.D. 1530, Humayun was crowned in it. The Fort got its present appearance during the reign of Akbar (A.D. 1556–1605). <br> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Fguw1os6wGP5tg148">google map link to visit agra fort</a> <br> <br><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7e/Agra_03-2016_10_Agra_Fort.jpg/450px-Agra_03-2016_10_Agra_Fort.jpg" height="500" width="500"> </p><br>

			<br><b>iii) Fatehpur Sikri </b><br>Fatehpur Sikri is a town in the Agra District of Uttar Pradesh, India. The city itself was founded as the capital of Mughal Empire in 1571 by Emperor Akbar, serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in Punjab and was later completely abandoned in 1610. <br> The name of the city is derived from the village called Sikri which occupied the spot before. An Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) excavation from 1999 to 2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by Sungas following their expansion. In 12th century, it was briefly controlled by Sikarwar Rajputs. <br> <p style="text-align: center;"> <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/ZWYY335KC5e6XPbu6">google map to visit fatehpur skri</a> <br> <br><img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.IqNEpXmsliO4WKyu-nCQGwHaEy&pid=Api&P=0&w=275&h=179" height="500" width="500"> </p></ul><br>
